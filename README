The application implements the knock sequence requirement,
uses 2 different tables to store secret and regular messages
(could have used one table with an isSecret column, but this looked cleaner).
When the user is in the secret mode, only secret messages are displayed,
while the regular messages are not. Likewise for regular mode. 

We use sessions and class variables to keep track of the secret status.
The application is HTML5 conformant and escapes html entities from user input in /message/add.
It decodes and displays the escaped html entities when /message/list is called.
Due to choice of freehost, I have only used strpos to compute which url is called.
URL rewriting is done on server side and the required code is in the .htaccess file.

The extra credit part is with me.
